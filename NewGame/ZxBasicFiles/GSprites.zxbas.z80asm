	; ----- IMPLEMENTATION NOTES ------
	; The heap is implemented as a linked list of free blocks.

; Each free block contains this info:
	;
	; +----------------+ <-- HEAP START
	; | Size (2 bytes) |
	; |        0       | <-- Size = 0 => DUMMY HEADER BLOCK
	; +----------------+
	; | Next (2 bytes) |---+
	; +----------------+ <-+
	; | Size (2 bytes) |
	; +----------------+
	; | Next (2 bytes) |---+
	; +----------------+   |
	; | <free bytes...>|   | <-- If Size > 4, then this contains (size - 4) bytes
	; | (0 if Size = 4)|   |
	; +----------------+ <-+
	; | Size (2 bytes) |
	; +----------------+
	; | Next (2 bytes) |---+
	; +----------------+   |
	; | <free bytes...>|   |
	; | (0 if Size = 4)|   |
	; +----------------+   |
	;   <Allocated>        | <-- This zone is in use (Already allocated)
	; +----------------+ <-+
	; | Size (2 bytes) |
	; +----------------+
	; | Next (2 bytes) |---+
	; +----------------+   |
	; | <free bytes...>|   |
	; | (0 if Size = 4)|   |
	; +----------------+ <-+
	; | Next (2 bytes) |--> NULL => END OF LIST
	; |    0 = NULL    |
	; +----------------+
	; | <free bytes...>|
	; | (0 if Size = 4)|
	; +----------------+


	; When a block is FREED, the previous and next pointers are examined to see
	; if we can defragment the heap. If the block to be breed is just next to the
	; previous, or to the next (or both) they will be converted into a single
	; block (so defragmented).


	;   MEMORY MANAGER
	;
	; This library must be initialized calling __MEM_INIT with
	; HL = BLOCK Start & DE = Length.

	; An init directive is useful for initialization routines.
	; They will be added automatically if needed.







	; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
	; MEM_REALLOC
	;  Reallocates a block of memory in the heap.
	;
	; Parameters
	;  HL = Pointer to the original block
	;  BC = New Length of requested memory block
	;
; Returns:
	;  HL = Pointer to the allocated block in memory. Returns 0 (NULL)
	;       if the block could not be allocated (out of memory)
	;
; Notes:
	;  If BC = 0, the block is freed, otherwise
	;  the content of the original block is copied to the new one, and
	;  the new size is adjusted. If BC < original length, the content
	;  will be truncated. Otherwise, extra block content might contain
	;  memory garbage.
