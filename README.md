# HERO
This is a little game I made for the ZX Spectrum

Use it as you wish ;)

## UPDATE

The game is finished, this is the V1.0
You can download the tapes and the game editor on the release section.
There's no manual for the level editor, it's very easy to use but I will add some instructions as I get a bit of time.

Hope you enjoy it!
